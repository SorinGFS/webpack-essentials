### Webpack Essentials

In order to be able to focus on the project itself the `webpack` specific packages can be moved into a separate package. This package contains an optimal list of `webpack` plugins, loaders and helpers which can now be installed in a single shot:

```shell
npm i -DE webpack-essentials
```

See `package.json` for the list of packages that will be installed.

#### Updates

When any of installed packages has a major release we will realease a patch.

#### Contributions

Please feel free to announce a major release (with or without pull request) or to propose some package that should be included here.
